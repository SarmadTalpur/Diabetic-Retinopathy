# Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using smartphone-based photography

## Introduction

According to WHO (World Health Organization), diabetes is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide. The prevalence of diabetes has been rapidly increasing in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). DR damages the retina and leads to arbitrary growth of blood vessels. It can make the vessels clot or burst as well. DR can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.

It is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, accounting for more than 3.9 million. However, it takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten the sight of a diabetic patient. Most patients remain asymptomatic until they reach advanced stages of DR. The available treatments for visual impairment caused by diabetes have been more effective at slowing visual loss than reversing visual impairment. Hence, early detection of DR before the permanent loss of vision is crucial to ensure better patient health.
